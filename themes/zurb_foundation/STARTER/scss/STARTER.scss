// This file is a custom file that loads all files. Each non-base layer

// Do not name this file "STARTER.scss". This file should be named
// THEMENAME.scss.
//
// This application file (THEMENAME.scss) is where all the partials are
// imported.
//
// Theme styles are categorized using SMACSS standards. They utilize
// categorization of styles into various categories. Those categories are the
// following:
//
// - Base: CSS reset/normalize plus HTML element styling.
// - Layout: Macro arrangement of a web page, including any grid systems.
// - Modules: Dictate minor layout modules or reusable elements.
// - States: Describe the appearance of a module in various states.
// - Theme: Specific customizations for your subtheme.
// For more information about this new Drupal css file standard, please review

// Foundation Components / Partials
// http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/sass.html#adjusting-css-output
//
// Note: The following include statements import sass partials for corresponding
// Foundation 6 features and components. If you do not need any of the features
// listed below feel free to comment each line out and re-compile.
//
// We are using Foundation's Float Grid (Legacy) for layout as our default.
// http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/grid.html
//
// Why not use the new XY Grid? The XY Grid system is a major update that has new
// markup requirements which would break other module integrations that currently
// work with ZURB Foundation for Drupal. Because we don't like to introduce breaking
// changes for websites we have elected to take this route for greater support.
//
// Note: This will likely change in future releases as the XY Grid becomes the
// new standard.
//
// Still want to use the XY Grid? Uncomment the foundation-xy-grid-classes include
// statement and recompile css.  You can now use the new XY Grid!
//
// http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/xy-grid.html
//
// WARNING: Including the XY Grid and disabling Float Grid will require that base
// theme provided template files be copied to your sub-theme and modified accordingly
// to match XY Grid markup requirements.
